    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium-sized apples, peeled, cored, and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened apple juice</li>
        <li>1 ripe banana</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey (optional, for added sweetness)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Ice cubes (optional, for a colder smoothie)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by preparing your apples. Peel them, remove the cores, and chop them into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the chopped apples, Greek yogurt, apple juice, milk, ripe banana, honey (if using), ground cinnamon, and vanilla extract into a blender.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a colder smoothie, you can also add a few ice cubes at this stage.</li>
        <li>Blend all the ingredients on high until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If the consistency is too thick, you can add a little more milk to reach your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Once blended to your satisfaction, pour the apple smoothie into a glass and serve immediately.</li>
